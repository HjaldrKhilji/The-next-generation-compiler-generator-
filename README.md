The code isnt complete yet(hence can have bugs), and is self explanatory. No copy right allowed! you can email me if you wonna collaborate, but I am not a fan of anyone copying my work. I know its nothing special, but I still  wanna be safe than sorry.
NOTE: this code assumes that your code is compiled using a compiler that supports the C++20 standard.
