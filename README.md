BIG NOTE: THE TOOL ISNT MEANT TO BE HUMAN READABLE OR FOR HUMANS, I WILL MAKE ANOTHER TOOL USING THIS ENGINE THAT TRANSLATE 
HUMAN READABLE FORMAT INTO THIS ONE.

The code isnt complete yet(hence can have bugs), and is self explanatory. No copy right allowed! you can email me if you wonna collaborate, but I am not a fan of anyone copying my work. I know its nothing special, but I still  wanna be safe than sorry.
NOTE: this code assumes that your code is compiled using a compiler that supports the C++23 standard.


I wont add any tests for now, I know that it sounds dumb, but its simply because my priority is to make its structure well, ...for now
