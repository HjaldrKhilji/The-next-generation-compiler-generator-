The code isnt complete yet(hence can have bugs), and is self explanatory. No copy right allowed! you can email me if you wonna collaborate, but I am not a fan of anyone copying my work. I know its nothing special, but I still  wanna be safe than sorry.
NOTE: this code assumes that your code is compiled using a compiler that supports the C++23 standard.


I know the code may be unreadable, but thats because I am wokring on it alone, so I need to make it readable for my self, by using long variables names, and I used reference_wrappers instead of pointers because the risk of something going wrong with pointers was far too big, specially because I am a single guy, who cant give every bug a lot of my time.

GOAL: The goal is simple, which is to help anyone with basic knowledge of regex expressions, read 2 pages on how to use my tool, and make any language that he wants. Once that is done, then I will add abstractions, just
like C++ did for C, but this time the abstractions are for compiler design, and useful for that only.

Why am I making this? well, as one fraustrated physicist might put it: I want a simpler notation to describe my formulas that still compile into standard notation without any hard work.
                      This applies to all fields.

The goal is for the base tool to be generic, but you should be able to use abstraction to special this tool and make other compiler generators that are specialized for a specific task.

This of my tool as a programming language with all general constructs to generate compilers
