The code isnt complete yet(hence can have bugs), and is self explanatory. No copy right allowed! you can email me if you wonna collaborate, but I am not a fan of anyone copying my work. I know its nothing special, but I still  wanna be safe than sorry.
NOTE: this code assumes that your code is compiled using a compiler that supports the C++23 standard.


I know the code may be unreadable, but thats because I am wokring on it alone, so I need to make it readable for my self, by using long variables names, and I used reference_wrappers instead of pointers because the risk of something going wrong with pointers was far too big, specially because I am a single guy, who cant give every bug a lot of my time.
