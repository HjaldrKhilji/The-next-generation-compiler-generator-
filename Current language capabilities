//this file changes fast
the code in main is purely for testing and showing what my code can currently do.
for example if you input this into my program now:
a a
b b\A a a kharquas +
you will get:
number of entries: 2
current entry:
a (a) syntaxical data:
next entry(if any):
current entry:
b (b(a)) syntaxical data:
number of nested entries in current entry: 1
a(a) semantic data of every syntaxical data:
number of semantic rules for current nested entry in current entry: 1
a (kharquas) 1 0
