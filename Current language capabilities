The current language capabilities is at stage one, which is the most basic stage:
you give a non term symbol name, and pattern
the pattern can contian \A to add nested patterns, in which case the nested pattern will replace \A
this is the basic base for lexical analysis config.
I am still working on semantical analysis which I will complete soon, 2 days to be exact because I am not gonna be working on my code tomorrow.

current language stage 1 capability is nothing special:
non_term_name_1 regex_pattern
non_term_name_2 regex_pattern\Asecond part non_term_name1
and so on

the input is parsed into the central data structure to store all entries
in my case I am taking input for two entries, and then simply printing the content of the table.
the code in main() is purely for testing!
