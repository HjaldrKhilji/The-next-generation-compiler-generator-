nothing works for now, I will finish the core part of it within a few weeks, replace standard regexes with optimized (non standard) ones, and at last debug all my code
I will use a seperate modules for regexes where the interface will be stable but the underlying library used to implement it can change if needed.
main focus right now is Output_modules and adding options.
